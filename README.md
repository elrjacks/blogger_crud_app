Pieces of your code will hold on to the data of your app, other peice may display that data, and other pieces control how you app functions and what business rules to follow.

### Model
This is the bulk of the code that doesn't have to do with displaying data. The model should contain most of the validation logic, application logic, and all database access logic. This is focused on dealing with the data directly and applying any needed functionality. 

### View
This section of code will only contain logic that is related to displaying the user interface. It is essentially how the data looks. 

### Controller
The controller will only have the bare minimum to return the correct view or to even redirect the user to another action.

## asp.NET MVC 
The asp.NET MVC framework provides a way to build dynamic websites that allow for clean separation of conerns.
